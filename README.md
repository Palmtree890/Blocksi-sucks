Welcome to Blocksi-sucks, forked from 3kh0 lite, for everyone who hates blocksi.

## Features
- Fast
- Clean
- Lightweight
- unblocked

## adding proxys soon

This site was created because i hate blocksi and needed to name a game website after it. if you have any game or proxy recemendations please comment them.

1. Fork this repo (give star pls :D)
2. Edit the files. (mainly the files in the `config` folder)
3. Optionally, add more games. ([Get some here](https://gitlab.com/3kh0/3kh0-assets))
4. Host it on your server or any static web host.
5. Enjoy!

> A known issue is game files; because some games are massive, they will fail on many services. There is no straightforward fix, but you can try to host the files on your server.
## Configuration

All the configuration is done in the `config` folder.
- `games.json`: It contains the games' names, icons, and link.

## To-Do
- Make it easier to add games
- Make a better README.md
